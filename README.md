The first loop asks the user to enter a number. The loop should iterate 10 times and keep a running total of the numbers 
entered. The second loop prints numbers starting at 20 and ending at 0. For every odd number, print "Buzz" instead of the 
number, and for every even number, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
